# Matter Heat Pump

I'm trying to create a Matter Heat Pump to learn more about Matter's energy management protocol. This project will serve as a device that supported power adjustment. 

This project uses matterjs and uses nextJs for the frontend and nodeJs for the backend.

## Running
To run this, you'll need to start both the frontend and backend.

For the backend
```
cd Backend
node app.js
```

For the frontend

```
cd Frontend
npm run dev
```

This code is rough around the edges, but should work!

I haven't tried it with Bluetooth, so you will need to ensure your devices are on-network when commissioning.
